# Il Paroliere (Boggle) for iOS

This app was made after a weekend with friends. We loved playing the game, 
and being able to play it everywhere without having the whole box is something I thought would be cool.

The interface is a single view completely written in SwiftUI, a Swift framework Apple has made available only for a couple of months 
at the time of writing, so finding documentation (even official) was a bit of a challenge, but I think the result has paid off:
- support for Dark Mode
- support for iOS, iPadOS and macOS via Catalyst all from one codebase
- SFSymbols compatibility (in this app, the two symbols at the beginning of the buttons)
